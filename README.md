This GitHub repository contains the source code for an official portfolio website built using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. The website utilizes the power of ReactJS for dynamic and reactive user interfaces, along with the styling capabilities of Tailwind CSS for a professional and modern look. The animation and motion design of the website is achieved with the help of Framer Motion, bringing a smooth and engaging experience to visitors. The portfolio website showcases the deepak's work experience, skills, and projects, providing a comprehensive and visually appealing platform to share his talent and connect with potential clients or employers. The use of these technologies ensures that the website is fast, responsive, and easy to maintain.
